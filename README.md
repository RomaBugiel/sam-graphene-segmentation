# sam-graphene-segmentation
This repository contains an experimental notebook applying the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** to transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM/SEM) images of graphene flakes.   It was developed as part of the **ACCORDS project** to explore whether foundation models can accelerate annotation of microscopy data.
